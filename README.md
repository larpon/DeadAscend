# Dead Ascend

A hand-drawn, open source, point'n'click-like 2D adventure game written in Qt/QML and Javascript.

"A horde of Zombies chased you to the old radio tower. Your only chance is to ascend up through the tower - solving a host of puzzles on your way to your rescue."

## Quick start

[Black Grain Games](http://games.blackgrain.dk/) are providing pre-build, ad-based, mobile and tablet versions.

 - [Android (Google Play)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blackgrain.android.deadascend.ad)
 - [iOS (Apple App Store)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dead-ascend/id1197443665?ls=1&mt=8)

By playing the pre-build versions above you are supporting my (indie) game productions.

Dead Ascend is now also available pre-build for [Linux, MacOS and Windows on itch.io](https://blackgrain.itch.io/dead-ascend)

## DIY Building

You can build the game from command line or with [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/ide/) (which usually comes bundled with [Qt](https://www.qt.io)).
It can be downloaded and installed in various ways so please refer to Qt homepage and documentation on howto get Qt Creator.

Once you have a fully working Qt/Qt Creator setup - you are ready to checkout and build "Dead Ascend".

1. Get codebase from GitHub

   ```
   cd /path/to/projects
   git clone https://github.com/larpon/DeadAscend.git
   ```
2. Install project dependencies

   ```
   cd /path/to/projects/DeadAscend/extensions/
   git clone https://github.com/larpon/qak.git
   git clone https://github.com/larpon/QtFirebase.git
   ```

   **NOTE**<br>
   If you are building for Android and/or iOS you also need to setup [QtFirebase](https://github.com/larpon/QtFirebase).
   Instructions and a working example is available [here](https://github.com/larpon/QtFirebaseExample).

3. Build

   a. Qt Creator

      - Open `/path/to/projects/DeadAscend/DeadAscend.pro` in Qt Creator
      - Choose your kit(s)
      - Add custom process step to build profile: Projects -> Build -> Build steps -> `/usr/bin/make` / `assetsrcc` / `%{buildDir}/App`
      ![Extra make target](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/larpon/DeadAscend/master/docs/img/QtCreatorProjectMakeStep.png)
      - Hit "Run"

   b. Command line

      ```
      cd /path/to/DeadAscend
      # BIN_DIR and ASSETS_DIR are optional
      qmake -r "BIN_DIR=/usr/bin" "ASSETS_DIR=/usr/share/deadascend"
      make assetsrcc -C App
      make
      make install
      ```
      You can now run `./App/DeadAscend` - or if you used `BIN_DIR`: `/usr/bin/DeadAscend`
